We're knights of the Round Table, we dance whene'er we're able. We do routines and chorus scenes with footwork impec-cable, We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and Spam a lot. / We're knights of the Round Table, our shows are for-mi-dable. But many times we're given rhymes that are quite un-sing-able, We're opera mad in Camelot, we sing from the diaphragm a lot. / In war we're tough and able, Quite in-de-fa-ti-gable. Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable / It's a busy life in Camelot

Minstrel: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot. He was not afraid to die, oh brave Sir Robin. He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways, brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin. He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken. To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, and his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin. His head smashed in and heart cut out, and his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged, and his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off and his penis...
Sir Robin: That's, uh, that's enough music for now, lads... looks like there's dirty work afoot.

1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Who goes there?

1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Pull the other one!
King Arthur: I am, and this is my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: What? Ridden on a horse?
King Arthur: Yes!
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: You're using coconuts!
King Arthur: What?
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.
King Arthur: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia, through...
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Where'd you get the coconuts?
King Arthur: We found them.
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's tropical!
King Arthur: What do you mean?
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Well, this is a temperate zone
King Arthur: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
King Arthur: Not at all. They could be carried.
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
King Arthur: It could grip it by the husk!
1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
King Arthur: Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?

King of Swamp Castle: No, just keep him in here...
Guard #1: Until you, or anyone else...
King of Swamp Castle: No, not anyone else. Just me.
Guard #1: Just you.
Guard #2: [hiccups]
King of Swamp Castle: Get back.
Guard #1: Get back.
King of Swamp Castle: All right?
Guard #1: Right, we'll stay here until you get back.
King of Swamp Castle: And make sure he doesn't leave.
Guard #1: What?
King of Swamp Castle: Make sure he doesn't leave.
Guard #1: The prince?
King of Swamp Castle: Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
Guard #1: Oh, yes, of course.
[Points at Guard #2]
Guard #1: I thought you meant him. You know, it seemed a bit daft me I were to guard him when he's a guard.
King of Swamp Castle: Is that clear?
Guard #2: [hiccups]
Guard #1: Oh, quite clear. No problems.
King of Swamp Castle: Right.
[King of Swamp Castle turns to leave the room, both guards follow him]
King of Swamp Castle: Where are you going?
Guard #1: We're coming with you.
King of Swamp Castle: No, no, no. I want you to stay here and make sure *he* doesn't leave.
Guard #1: Oh, I see. Right.

King Arthur: [about the inscription on the rock] What does it say, Brother Maynard?
Brother Maynard: It reads, "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Aramathia. He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the holy grail in the Castle of Aaauuuggghhh... "
King Arthur: What?
Brother Maynard: "The Castle of Aaaauuuggghhhh"
Sir Bedevere: What is that?
Brother Maynard: He must have died while carving it.
King Arthur: Oh come on!
Brother Maynard: Well, that's what it says.
King Arthur: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't have bothered to carve 'Aaaauuuggghhhh'. He'd just say it.
Sir Galahad: Maybe he was dictating it.
King Arthur: Oh shut up!
Sir Robin: Well does it say anything else?
Brother Maynard: No, just "Aaaaauuuugggghhh".
[knights making groaning sounds]
Sir Bedevere: Do you think he could have mean, 'Camaaaauuuuggghhhh'?
Sir Galahad: Where's that?
Sir Bedevere: France, I think.
Sir Lancelot: Isn't there a Saint "Aaaaavvvveeeesss" in Cornwall?
King Arthur: No that's Saint "Ives".
Sir Lancelot: Oh, yes. "Iiiiiivvvveeessss"!
[All knights saying, "Iiiiiivvvveeessss"]
Sir Bedevere: Whooooouuuuaaa!
Sir Lancelot: No no no, it's "Aaaaauuuugggghhhh" from the back of the throat.
Sir Bedevere: No I mean, "Whoooouuuuaaa!" as in surprise and alarm.
Sir Lancelot: Oh, you mean like, "AAAHH!"

Capt. Kirk: Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its 5-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.
"... a dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars" -- Kirk (Whom Gods Destroy)
"Just before they went into warp, I beamed the whole kit and kaboodle into their engine room, where they'll be no tribble at all." -- Scotty, explaining how he got rid of the tribbles (The Trouble With Tribbles)

"You are authorized to use all measures available to destroy the Enterpise" -- Starfleet Command Representative (The Ultimate Computer)
"I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise should be hauling garbage. I meant to say that it should be hauled away AS garbage" -- Korax (The Trouble With Tribbles)
"Random chance seems to have operated in our favor" -- Spock
"In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky" -- McCoy
"I believe I said that, Doctor" -- Spock (The Doomsday Machine)
"Unbelievable. Do you recognize those uniforms?" -- Kirk
"Mid 20th century Earth. The nation-state called Nazi Germany." -- Spock (Patterns of Force)
"You look quite well for a man that's been 'utterly destroyed', Mr. Spock." -- Kirk (Patterns of Force)
"In four hours the ship blows up" -- Scotty (The Savage Curtain)
"Computer, compute to the last digit the value of pi" -- Spock (Wolf in the Fold)
"What are we looking at, a 20th century Rome?" -- Kirk (Bread and Circuses)
"Is there anyone on this ship, who even remotely, looks like Satan?" -- Kirk
"I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain" -- Spock
"No, Mr. Spock, I didn't think you would be" -- Kirk (The Apple)
"Mr. Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in the galaxy that can make that claim." -- Kirk (Elaan of Troyius)
"Does everyone know about this grain but me?" -- Kirk
"Not everyone, Kepten, it's a Russian inwention." -- Checkov (The Trouble With Tribbles)

"Scotch?" -- Checkov
"Aye." -- Scott
"It vas inwented by a little old lady in Lenningrad." -- Checkov (The Trouble With Tribbles)
"Emotional, isn't she?" -- Spock
"She has always been so." -- Sarek
"Indeed. Why did you marry her?" -- Spock
"It seemed the logical thing to do at the time." -- Sarek (Journey To Babel)

"Stop it? I'm counting on it!" -- Kirk (A Taste of Armegedon)
"Now Mr. Spock, there's really something about all this that I don't understand, so maybe you could explain it to me, logically of course... Now, when you jettisoned the fuel, and ignited it, you knew that there was virtually no chance of it being seen and yet you did it anyway. Now that seems to me like an act of desperation." -- Kirk
"Quite correct, Captain." -- Spock
"Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor would agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. So how does your well known logic explain that?" -- Kirk
"Quite simply captain, I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only logical action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at." -- Spock
"Ah-huh, I see... So you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst." -- Kirk
"Well I... Wouldn't exactly put it in those terms captain, but those are essentially the facts." -- Spock
[sighs] "You aren't going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human, emotional act?" -- Kirk
[crosses arms and slowly shakes head] "No, sir." -- Spock

Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Captain, a starship also runs on loyalty to one man. And nothing can replace it or him.

On my planet "to rest" is to rest, to cease using energy. To me it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.

2. By golly, Jim - I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day!

  3. Just a moment, Captain, sir. I'll explain what happened. Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little known, seldom used, reserve activation clause. In simpler language, Captain, they drafted me!

4. I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!
I'm a doctor, not a psychiatrist.
I'm a doctor, not an engineer!
I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.
I'm a doctor, not an escalator!

"Careful, Jim. The drink might be poisoned..."

How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life.

Please, Captain, not in front of the Klingons.
-Spock to Kirk, as Kirk is about to hug him, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier
It is possible to commit no errors and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life.
-Captain Picard to Data, Star Trek: The Next Generation, “Peak Performance”
David Marcus: You were smart enough to tell Saavik that how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life.
Kirk: Just words…
David Marcus: But good words. That’s where ideas begin.
-Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
I like my species the way it is.
-Worf, Star Trek: The Next Generation, “The Best of Both Worlds”
Our gods are dead. Ancient Klingon warriors slew them a millenia ago. They were...more trouble than they were worth.
-Worf, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, “Homefront” (And no, I don’t know why it is one millennia...)
Money is money, but women...are better.
-Nog (a Ferengi), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, “Life Support”
Take my Worf, please.
-Data, trying to imitate comedians, Star Trek: The Next Generation, “The Outrageous Okona”
If you don’t mind, I’d like to borrow your bodies for a few hours.

Fate: protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise.
-Commander Riker, Star Trek: The Next Generation, “Contagion”
Kirk: Spock, where the hell’s the power you promised?
Spock: One damn minute, Admiral.
-Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home
Picard: Come back! Make a difference!
Kirk: I take it the odds are against us and the situation’s grim.
Picard: You could say that.
Kirk: If Spock were here, he’d say that I was an irrational, illlogical human being for going on a mission like this... Sounds like fun!
-Star Trek: Generations
Rumors of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated.
-Captain Picard, Star Trek: First Contact
Assimilate this!
-Worf, Star Trek: First Contact
Believing oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind.
-Data, to Borg Queen, Star Trek: First Contact
Data: She [the Borg Queen] brought me closer to humanity than I ever thought possible. And for a time, I was tempted by her offer.
Picard: How long a time?
Data: Zero point six-eight seconds, sir... For an android, that is nearly an eternity.
-Star Trek: First Contact

-Gowron, Klingon proverb, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine

We have them just where they want us.

-on Lt. Barclay, Star Trek: The Next Generation, "Genesis"
Kirk: Come on. Spock, why didn't you jump in? 
Spock: I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words. 
McCoy: It's a song, you green-blooded...Vulcan. You sing it. The words aren't important. What's important is that you have a good time singing it.
Spock: Oh, I am sorry, Doctor. Were we having a good time? 
McCoy: God, I liked him better before he died.
-Star Trek V: The Final Frontier
Spock: This is the new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof. 
Kirk: How do you know?
Spock: The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape. 
Kirk: This person didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he? 
Spock: He did have pointed ears.
-Star Trek V: The Final Frontier

-James Kirk, on life, Star Trek: Generations
For everything, there is a first time.”
“I have been — and always shall be — your friend.”
“Live long, and prosper.”
“Space… the final frontier.”‘
“So much for the little training cruise.”
“Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.”
“He tasks me. He tasks me; and I shall have him. I’ll chase him ’round the moons of Nibia and ’round the Antares maelstrom and ’round Perdition’s flames before I give him up.”
“This… is Ceti Alpha Five.”
“Do not grieve, Admiral. It was logical. The needs of the… many outweigh… “…The needs of the few.” (…Spock grimaces, nods.) ”…Or the one.”
“Lieutenant, you are looking at the only man to beat the no-win scenario.”
“Everyone remember where we parked.”
“Genesis?” (Blank pause.) “What’s that?”
“Let them eat static.”
“Do you know the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold? It is very cold — in space.”
“Time’s up — Admiral.” “…Here it comes.”
“…Warp speed.”
“You cheated.”
“You lied.”
“I changed the conditions of the test. I don’t like to lose.”
“No, Kirk, no. You’ll not escape. From hell’s heart, I stab at thee. …For spite’s sake, I spit my last breath at thee.”
“I’ll say this for him; he’s consistent.”
“Hours instead of days! Now, we have minutes instead of hours.”
“I’ve done far worse than kill you. …I’ve hurt you; and I intend to go on… hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. …Buried alive; buried alive….”
“How do I feel? I feel old — worn out.” “…Then let me show you something that will make you feel… young — as when the world was new.“
“The word is given.”
“Yours — is the superior intellect.”
“You’ve never really faced death, have you?” “...No; not like this. I haven’t faced death. I’ve cheated death. I’ve tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing.”
“You knew enough — to tell Lieutenant Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life.”
“…Just words.”
“But good words; that’s where ideas begin. …Maybe you should listen to them.”
“Simple… logic.”
“I like to believe that there are always possibilities.”
“Don’t tell me — you’re from outer space.” “…No, I’m from Iowa. I only work in space.”
“…Damn.” (…Tosses symbolically shattered glasses aside.)
“This isn’t reality. This — is fantasy.”
“…Ship? Out of danger?”
“Please let me know if there’s some other way we can screw up tonight.”
“He’s so… human.” (She shudders.) “…Nobody’s perfect, Saavik.”
“NUCLEAR WESSELS.”
“Admiral! There be whales here!”
“Don’t – call me ‘tiny.’”
“‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ …Message, Spock?” “…None that I am conscious of — save, perhaps, for ‘Happy Birthday.‘”
“Of my friend I can only say this: of all the souls that I met on my travels, his was the most… human.”
“It’s a — far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before; a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known.” “…Is that a poem?” “…Mmm. Something Spock was trying to tell me — on my birthday.”
“…Admiral? All my hopes.” (…The men shimmer into light and then vanish.)
“Well, once again, we’ve saved civilization as we know it.” “…And the good news is, they’re not going to prosecute.“
“To boldly go where no man — where no one — has gone… before.”
“Let’s see what’s out there.”
“Course heading, Captain?”
“…Second star to the right — and straight on ’til morning.” 
Admiral?' 'Admiral!' 'Admiral'... Never told you how Admiral Kirk sent 70 of us into exile in this barren sandheap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
KHHHHAAAAAAAAN!
I exaggerated.
FULL POWER!
ogic is the beginning of wisdom; not the end. - Spock
Mr. Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in the galaxy that can make that claim. - Kirk
Live long and prosper - Spock
Spock. This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth. Now, what do you suggest we do....spank it? - Dr. McCoy
Everyone remember where we parked. - Captain Kirk
I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was in diapers! - Captain Kirk
Well, are you a doctor or aren't you? - Captain Kirk
Kirk: I hope I'm not crowding you.
Cogley: What's the matter? Don't you like books?
Kirk: Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space.
Cogley: A computer, huh? I got one of these in my office. Contains all the precedents, a synthesis of all the great legal decisions written throughout time. I never use it.
Kirk: Why not?
Cogley: I've got my own system. Books, young man, books. Thousands of them. If time wasn't so important, I'd show you something--my library. Thousands of books.
Kirk: What would be the point?
Cogley: This is where the law is, not in that homogenized, pasteurized, synthesized... do you want to know the law, the ancient concepts in their own language, learn the intent of the men who wrote them, from Moses to the tribunal of Alpha 3? Books.
Kirk: You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney-at-law.
Cogley: Right on both counts.
McCoy: Well, I had to see it to believe it.
Spock: Explain.
McCoy: They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're playing chess with the computer.
Spock: That is true.
McCoy: Mr. Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known.
Spock: Why, thank you, Doctor.
Spock: Insufficient facts always invite danger.
Spock: Superior ability breeds superior ambition.
Spock:The mid-1990s was the era of your last so-called World War.
McCoy: (Khan has grabbed McCoy by throat and is holding a knife on him) Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind.
Khan: Where am I?
McCoy: You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat.
Khan: Answer my question!
McCoy: It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear.
Khan [releasing McCoy]: I like a brave man.
McCoy [taking knife from Khan]: I was just trying to prevent an argument.
Scotty: Diplomats! The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser bank.
McCoy: Well, Scotty, now you've done it.
Scotty: Aye, the haggis is in the fire, for sure.
Ambassador: What are you doing, Mr. Spock?
Spock: Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir. [Fires phaser]
Kirk: Death. Destruction. Disease. Horror. That's what war is all about. That's what makes it a thing to be avoided.
Kirk: Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on.
Kirk: [War] is instinctive. But the instinct can be fought. We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands! But we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers ... but we're not going to kill today. That's all it takes! Knowing that we're not going to kill - today!
Spock: Captain, you almost make me believe in luck.
Kirk: Why, Mr Spock! You almost make me believe in miracles!
Kirk: ...You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?
Spock: I thought you might.
Kirk: You're right.
Kor: You speak of courage. Obviously you do not know the difference between courage and foolhardiness. Always it is the brave ones who die, the soldiers.
Kirk: I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. I can only tell you the truth!
Kirk: Another Armenia, Belgium ... the weak innocents...they always seem to be located along the natural invasion routes.
Kirk: Now, Mr.Spock and I are going to go out there ... and quite probably die. In an attempt to show you ... that there are some things ... worth dying for.
Kirk: What would you say the odds are on our getting out of here?
Spock: Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately seven thousand eight hundred twenty four point seven to one.
Kirk: Difficult to be precise? Seven thousand eight hundred and twenty four to one?
Spock: Seven thousand eight hundred twenty four point seven to one.
Kirk: That's a pretty close approximation.
Spock: I endeavour to be accurate.
Kirk: You do quite well.
Kirk: Well, what are the odds now?
Spock: Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've gotten this far.
Kirk: Less than seven thousand to one... Well, getting better, getting better.
James T. Kirk: Conquest is easy. Control is not.
Mirror Spock: Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the logic of history.
James T. Kirk: How long before the Halkan prediction of Galactic revolt is realized?
Mirror Spock: Approximately 240 years.
James T. Kirk: The inevitable outcome?
Mirror Spock: The Empire shall be overthrown, of course.
James T. Kirk: The illogic of waste, Mr. Spock. The waste of lives, potential, resources, time. . .I submit to you that your Empire is illogical, because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to being a willing part of it.
James T. Kirk: In every revolution, there's one man with a vision.
Mirror Spock: One man cannot summon the future.
James T. Kirk: But one man can change the present.
Spock: (Explaining to Kirk how the mirror versions were so quickly spotted) It was far easier for you as civilized men to behave like barbarians than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilized men.
Kirk: I'm not sure, but I think we've just been insulted.
McCoy: I'm sure.
James T. Kirk: Spock, comment.
Spock: Very bad poetry, Captain.
James T. Kirk: A more useful comment, Mr Spock.
James T. Kirk: If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead, I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us.
Spock: Trick or treat, Captain?
James T. Kirk: Yes, Mr Spock. You'd be a natural.
James T. Kirk: You can't think a man to death.Zefram Cochrane: Immortality consists largely of boredom.
James T. Kirk: Not 100 percent efficient, of course, but nothing ever is.
James T. Kirk: The idea of male and female are universal constants.
Leonard McCoy: There's nothing disgusting about it [the Companion]. It's just another life form, that's all. You get used to those things.
James T. Kirk: We're on over a thousand worlds and spreading out. Life is everywhere.
Amanda Grayson: After all these years among humans, you still haven't learned to smile.
Spock: Humans smile with so little provocation.
Amanda Grayson: Vulcans believe that peace should not depend on force.
Spock: There is no logic in Gav's murder.
Shras: Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain; these are reasons for murder.
Spock: It [being a Vulcan] means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be.
Sarek: One does not thank logic.
[Sarek and Spock discuss Amanda.]
Spock: Emotional, isn't she?
Sarek: She has always been that way.
Spock: Indeed? Why did you marry her?
Sarek: At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do.
Leonard McCoy: I'm a doctor, not an escalator
Spock: Virtue is a relative term.
Leonard McCoy: Oochy-woochy-koochy-coo.
Spock: "Oochy wootchy koochy coo," Captain?
James T. Kirk: An obscure Earth dialect, Mr. Spock. Oochy-woochy-koochy-coo. If you're curious, consult linguistics.
Spock: "The child was named Leonard...James...Akaar?!"
McCoy: "Has a kind of a...ring to it, don't you think, James?"
Kirk: "Yes. I think it's a name...destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard - what do you think, Spock?"
Spock: I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month. Sir.
Montgomery Scott: Aye, and deadly, too. What are you thinking of, Doc? Are you trying to kill us all?
